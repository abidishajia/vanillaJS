I decided to go with vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap for this project. 

Our index.html page contains a simple markup for an input field and a button. 

Our app.js file is where the magic happens. 

document.querySelector() - this gets the first element that matches the specified selector.
We then add an eventListener to the button we got from querySelector(). Event Listener could be
anything from a click to a mouseover. There are many different kind of eventListeners, but we only
used the 'click' eventListener. eventListener takes in a callback function which fires when a user clicks on an element.

We use fetch and promises to get data from an external source i.e. website. Fetch allows us to make network requests so we can
get, post and delete data. In our project, we are only getting the data from the specified urls.

After we fetched the data from both of the urls, we joined both the arrays of object on the userId. We did this by creating
an empty object first. Then using the forEach loop, we added the users into the object. We achieved this by using userId as the key and the user 
in users as the value.

Similarly, we then iterated over the posts arrayvand added the value in the object we created depending on the users. 
We passed the result into our helper function. 

Our helper function is called postsDisplay which checks for a condition, and if it is true it displays some posts. 
The condition it checks is if the value entered by the user is present in the obj we passed in our helper function. 
If it is, then it creates new elements using document.createElement(), adds new classes using classList.add, adds some text 
using textContent and innerHTML, and adds it to the DOM using appendChild.

Our last click button clears the screen by setting innerHTML = ""
